                    Thinking back to times before I started noticing Is it really selfish, 
                    I just want to be myself You don't love me the way I love you
                    Too blind to see, it's sad but it's true Baby, won't you let me know
                    Did you see her when you're looking at me
                    I'm not her shadow, no more
                </p>
                    So look at you now I take a bow
                    Thanks for all the lessons learned
                    Showing me how We would end up
                    Play with fire, you get burned
                    It's not that I don't care
                    But this love's beyond repair
                    So look at me now I'm better on my own
                <p>
                    I'm still hoping someday, maybe we can work it out
                    If you really want to figure what it's all about But you don't love me the way I love you
                    Too blind to see, it's sad but it's true Baby, won't you let me know
                    Oh, did you see her when you're looking at me I'm not her shadow, no more
                </p>
                <p>
                    So look at you now I take a bow Thanks for all the lessons learned
                    Showing me how We would end up Play with fire, you get burned
                    It's not that I don't care But this love's beyond repair
                    So look at me now Yeah I'm better on my own

                    "Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. 
                    Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude" (By Denis Waitley).
